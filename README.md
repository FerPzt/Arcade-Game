Your goal is to get to the water without touching any bug in the way.

The commands are made by the keyboard, using the arrows up, down, left and right. You move one block at the time.

When the player touches a bug, it immediately goes back to the initial position.

Once you get to the water, the game is won and a congratulations pop up is opened so you can play it again.
